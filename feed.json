            "content_text": "UTCG Shaders WorkshopIntroWhat are we gonna cover?This workshop covers the basics of 2D shader programming in GLSL. We’re hoping that by the end of the workshop, you have a good enough grasp on shader programming that you can make your own animated noise art, and get started working on more complicated shaders for your own graphics and game development projects (or Minecraft). Here are some examples of shaders we made using only the techniques covered in this workshop:(make sure to click play on this one, and press the ⏮ button to restart)We hope that you follow along through the code during the workshop, whether you’re writing it yourself with us or uncommenting lines as we write them. Below is all the code we’ll be using:  Part 1: Mandelbrot          Minimal starter code: https://www.shadertoy.com/view/NdSyW3      Starter code with finished example commented out: https://www.shadertoy.com/view/NdsyDX      Finished code: https://www.shadertoy.com/view/fsSyW3        Part 2: Clock          Minimal starter code: https://www.shadertoy.com/view/NsSyW3      Starter code with finished example commented out: https://www.shadertoy.com/view/fsByW3      Finished code: https://www.shadertoy.com/view/fdByW3        Part 3: Noise art          Starter code: https://www.shadertoy.com/view/7s2yzy      Example finished code: https://www.shadertoy.com/view/ssScDw        Competition          Starter code: https://www.shadertoy.com/view/fsBcWd      What is a shader?A pixel shader (aka fragment shader) is code that runs for each pixel being rendered. There are other types of shaders (e.g. vertex shaders, geometry shaders, etc) but we won’t cover them in this workshop. Generally, they’re code that runs on the GPU, usually for rendering graphics. In games, they’re usually used for lighting effects (they are called shaders) and other fancy effects at the end of the rendering pipeline. GPUs are great for shaders, because they’re made for doing similar work for lots of different inputs - in this case, they’ll run the same shader code for each pixel on the screen.Coding shadersShaders are usually written in GLSL, which is OpenGL Shading Language. It’s kind of like C/C++. This is the language that Minecraft shaders use!One important thing to note is that it does not automatically convert between integers and floats. So it will throw an error if you do something like float x = 2; or float y = M_PI / 2. To deal with this, always put a . after an integer, e.g. float x = 2. and float y = M_PI / 2..Fragment shader basics, Transformations, Colour - Mandelbrot SetTo learn the basics, let’s start by rendering the Mandelbrot set. We’ve provided some starter code, linked below. We won’t be paying much attention to the mathematics behind the Mandelbrot set, so the mandel() function is provided (and you don’t need to understand it).Code:  Minimal starter code: https://www.shadertoy.com/view/NdSyW3  Starter code with finished example commented out: https://www.shadertoy.com/view/NdsyDX  Finished code: https://www.shadertoy.com/view/fsSyW3What does our shader need to do?Our fragment shader’s input is a pixel on the screen and its output is its colour, as a 4D RGBA (Red/Green/Blue/Alpha) vector.void mainImage( out vec4 fragColor, in vec2 fragCoord ){    ...}We’ve given a variable vec2 uv to represent the transformed coordinates of a pixel. We’ll use it and mandel() to calculate the colour for each pixel.void mainImage( out vec4 fragColor, in vec2 fragCoord ){    vec2 uv = fragCoord/iResolution.x;    // mandel returns a value between 0 and 1    float value = mandel(uv.x, uv.y);    vec3 col = vec3(value, value, value);    fragColor = vec4(col, 1.);}Since we’ve put value into the R/G/B parts of col, the resulting image should be in greyscale.TransformationWe mentioned that uv are the transformed coordinates. You might recall from high school that we can transform coordinates by multiplying/dividing our vector by a number to stretch, or by adding/subtracting another vector to shift. Try doing this yourself to get the whole set in the frame!void mainImage( out vec4 fragColor, in vec2 fragCoord ){    vec2 uv = vec2(fragCoord.x / hrztl_stretch - hrztl_shift,                   fragCoord.y / vrtcl_stretch - vrtcl_shift);    ...}Working with colour - mix()We can make other colours by putting different values into the R/G/B parts of col, e.g. red = vec3(1., .5, .5) or blue = vec3(.25, .5, 1.).We can also interpolate between colours (or really anything) using the GLSL function mix(). The first two arguments are the values we want to interpolate between, and the last is the “slider value” to “slide” between the two, from 0 to 1.vec3 red = vec3(1., .5, .5);vec3 blue = vec3(.25, .5, 1.);vec3 col = mix(red, blue, mandel);ExtrasThrow sin(), cos(), and iTime into your colour calculation and we’ve got a rave going!Rotation, Time, Circles - Analogue ClockOur next example is an analogue clock.Code:  Minimal starter code: https://www.shadertoy.com/view/NsSyW3  Starter code with finished example commented out: https://www.shadertoy.com/view/fsByW3  Finished code: https://www.shadertoy.com/view/fdByW3Note that this time we’ve transformed the pixel coordinates for you, so that the centre of the screen has coordinates $(0, 0)$.Creating the clock faceClocks are circles. This is basic anthropology. But what is a circle?A circle is all the points within some radius $r$ of the centre of the circle $\\mathbf c$. So if we have a pixel whose coordinates are $\\mathbf p = (x, y)$, then we can check if the pixel is within the circle by checking if $\\text{length}(\\mathbf p - \\mathbf c) &lt; r$. Let’s make a function to do that using the GLSL length() function:bool isInCircle(vec2 centre, float radius, vec2 point){    // return true if point is closer to centre than r    return length(point - centre) &lt; radius;}Let’s set the centre of our clock to be the centre of the screen, and give it a radius of 0.4:vec2 clockCentre = vec2(0, 0);float clockRadius = 0.4;And now, let’s use our circle function to colour the clock face red:if (isInCircle(clockCentre, clockRadius, uv)){    col = vec3(1., 0.5, 0.5);}If you render now, you should see a big red circle in the middle of the screen!Initializing the seconds handThe initial position of a clock hand, at time 0 is pointing straight up, so let’s create an up vector to represent that:vec2 up = vec2(0, 0.2);Now let’s render it as a small white dot, the same way we rendered the clock face:vec2 secondsHand = up;float handRadius = 0.02;// put the following code AFTER the clock face colour codeif (isInCircle(secondsHand, handRadius, uv)){    col = vec3(1, 1, 1);}Making it moveUsing linear algebra, we’ve created a rot() function which returns a matrix that will rotate a 2D vector clockwise by a given angle in radians (more on rotation matrices). To get a rotated vector, you multiply a rotation matrix times a vector. For example,vec2 northEast = vec2(1, 1);vec2 southEast = rot(0.5 * M_PI) * northEast;In our case, we want to rotate our clock hand by some angle based on time. GLSL gives us a handy variable iTime, which is the time in seconds since we started the shader. Let’s try it out by editing our seconds hand’s position:vec2 secondsHand = rot(iTime) * up;Getting the speed rightGreat, it’s rotating! But it’s the wrong speed. One full rotation is $2\\pi$ (aka 2. * M_PI) radians, and it takes 60 seconds, so we’ll rotate our seconds hand correspondingly:float seconds = iTime;// 60 seconds for a rotationvec2 secondsHand = rot(seconds / 60. * 2. * M_PI) * up;Now we have a seconds hand! Let’s try a minutes hand next, using the same strategy:float minutes = seconds / 60.// 60 mins for a rotationvec2 minutesHand = rot(minutes / 60. * 2. * M_PI) * up;...if (isInCircle(minutesHand, handRadius, uv)){    col = vec3(1, 1, 1);}Try doing an hour hand yourself!ExtrasTo make the clock show the actual time, take a look at the GLSL iDate variable. Note that this is a 4D vector. To make it even more clock-like, see if you can use the GLSL floor() function to make the seconds hand “tick” instead of rotating smoothly.You can also make it look better by changing the lengths of the hands, so that they never overlap. Other aesthetic upgrades could be a bezel, or patterns on the clock face. Numbers are a bit more difficult, but look into textures if you have some time and wanna try it out.Using sin() and cos() creatively - Noise artThe goal of this workshop was to give you enough shaders knowledge to make cool noise art, like this:How do we do this?…Just kinda messing around tbh.Code:  Starter code for example: https://www.shadertoy.com/view/7s2yzy  Example finished code: https://www.shadertoy.com/view/ssScDw  Competition starter code: https://www.shadertoy.com/view/fsBcWdCreating patterns with functionsWe know we can mix() two colours as long as we have a value between 0 and 1. And since the trigonometric functions sin() and cos() are periodic, we can use them to create patterns. We can also combine them in weird ways to get unexpected patterns.float noiseFunc(float x, float y){    return something;}sin() and cos() both range between -1 and 1, so we need to transform them to the range we want.float noiseFunc(float x, float y){    float val = cos(...);    // transform cos value so that it's between 0 and 1    return 0.5 + 0.5 * val;}What do we put inside that cos() function? Anything basically. Go crazy. Just do random stuff. Better if you mix x, y, iTime, more trigonometry, etc in there. Here’s what I did for the example above:float noiseFunc(float x, float y){    float val = cos(x                    + sin(2. * y + cos(x + iTime))                    + cos(iTime + x + cos(4. * y))                    + 10. * sin(x)                    );    // transform cos value so that it's between 0 and 1    return 0.5 + 0.5 * val;}Feel free to mix more colours, to use if/else to render different things for different parts of the screen, use the functions we provided earlier such as mandel(), rot(), and isInCircle, and etc. Go crazy.When you’re done, submit your shader to the competition by listing it as “public” and adding the tag utcg2022.The endThat’s the end of the workshop, hope you learned a lot and had fun!What you can do with thisIf you scroll down on Shadertoy, at the bottom of the screen you’ll see a link to a Screensaver plugin made by Kosro, which can be used to turn your shaders into a screensaver for Windows when installed on top of Wallpaper Engine.Where to learn moreThe Book of Shaders is an incomplete resource on GLSL programming, but the pages it does have are excellent quality and easy to follow. They’re especially great if you’re interested in more complex noise art, like this from page 11.The real heavyweight in shaders is Inigo Quiles, co-creator of Shadertoy. His website has articles, tutorials, demos, and more of graphics programming, including more noise art like this.There are many more tutorials on shaders that are just a search away, since GLSL is a very widely-used technology. Plus, they’re covered a little bit in CSC317 - Computer Graphics (formerly CSC418).Thanks!If you enjoyed this workshop, make sure you follow us on social media, join our mailing list, and join our Discord to keep up with our other events!

Let’s make a function to do that using the GLSL <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">length()</code> function:</p><div class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>bool isInCircle(vec2 centre, float radius, vec2 point){    // return true if point is closer to centre than r    return length(point - centre) &lt; radius;}</code></pre></div></div><p>Let’s set the centre of our clock to be the centre of the screen, and give it a radius of 0.4:</p><div class=\"language-glsl highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code><span class=\"kt\">vec2</span> <span class=\"n\">clockCentre</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"kt\">vec2</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"mi\">0</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"mi\">0</span><span class=\"p\">);</span><span class=\"kt\">float</span> <span class=\"n\">clockRadius</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"mi\">0</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"mi\">4</span><span class=\"p\">;</span></code></pre></div></div><p>And now, let’s use our circle function to colour the clock face red:</p><div class=\"language-glsl highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code><span class=\"k\">if</span> <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">isInCircle</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">clockCentre</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"n\">clockRadius</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"n\">uv</span><span class=\"p\">))</span><span class=\"p\">{</span>    <span class=\"n\">col</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"kt\">vec3</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"mi\">1</span><span class=\"p\">.,</span> <span class=\"mi\">0</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"mi\">5</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"mi\">0</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"mi\">5</span><span class=\"p\">);</span><span class=\"p\">}</span></code></pre></div></div><p>If you render now, you should see a big red circle in the middle of the screen!</p><h3 id=\"initializing-the-seconds-hand\">Initializing the seconds hand</h3><p>The initial position of a clock hand, at time 0 is pointing straight up, so let’s create an <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">up</code> vector to represent that:</p><div class=\"language-glsl highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code><span class=\"kt\">vec2</span> <span class=\"n\">up</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"kt\">vec2</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"mi\">0</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"mi\">0</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"mi\">2</span><span class=\"p\">);</span></code></pre></div></div><p>Now let’s render it as a small white dot, the same way we rendered the clock face:</p><div class=\"language-glsl highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code><span class=\"kt\">vec2</span> <span class=\"n\">secondsHand</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"n\">up</span><span class=\"p\">;</span><span class=\"kt\">float</span> <span class=\"n\">handRadius</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"mi\">0</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"mo\">02</span><span class=\"p\">;</span><span class=\"c1\">// put the following code AFTER the clock face colour code</span><span class=\"k\">if</span> <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">isInCircle</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">secondsHand</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"n\">handRadius</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"n\">uv</span><span class=\"p\">))</span><span class=\"p\">{</span>    <span class=\"n\">col</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"kt\">vec3</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"mi\">1</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"mi\">1</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"mi\">1</span><span class=\"p\">);</span><span class=\"p\">}</span></code></pre></div></div><h3 id=\"making-it-move\">Making it move</h3><p>Using linear algebra, we’ve created a <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">rot()</code> function which returns a matrix that will rotate a 2D vector clockwise by a given angle in radians (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotation_matrix\">more on rotation matrices</a>). To get a rotated vector, you multiply a rotation matrix times a vector. For example,</p><div class=\"language-glsl highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code><span class=\"kt\">vec2</span> <span class=\"n\">northEast</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"kt\">vec2</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"mi\">1</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"mi\">1</span><span class=\"p\">);</span><span class=\"kt\">vec2</span> <span class=\"n\">southEast</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"n\">rot</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"mi\">0</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"mi\">5</span> <span class=\"o\">*</span> <span class=\"n\">M_PI</span><span class=\"p\">)</span> <span class=\"o\">*</span> <span class=\"n\">northEast</span><span class=\"p\">;</span></code></pre></div></div><p>In our case, we want to rotate our clock hand by some angle based on time. GLSL gives us a handy variable <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">iTime</code>, which is the time in seconds since we started the shader. Let’s try it out by editing our seconds hand’s position:</p><div class=\"language-glsl highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code><span class=\"kt\">vec2</span> <span class=\"n\">secondsHand</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"n\">rot</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">iTime</span><span class=\"p\">)</span> <span class=\"o\">*</span> <span class=\"n\">up</span><span class=\"p\">;</span></code></pre></div></div><h3 id=\"getting-the-speed-right\">Getting the speed right</h3><p>Great, it’s rotating! But it’s the wrong speed. One full rotation is $2\\pi$ (aka <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">2. * M_PI</code>) radians, and it takes 60 seconds, so we’ll rotate our seconds hand correspondingly:</p><div class=\"language-glsl highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code><span class=\"kt\">float</span> <span class=\"n\">seconds</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"n\">iTime</span><span class=\"p\">;</span><span class=\"c1\">// 60 seconds for a rotation</span><span class=\"kt\">vec2</span> <span class=\"n\">secondsHand</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"n\">rot</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">seconds</span> <span class=\"o\">/</span> <span class=\"mi\">60</span><span class=\"p\">.</span> <span class=\"o\">*</span> <span class=\"mi\">2</span><span class=\"p\">.</span> <span class=\"o\">*</span> <span class=\"n\">M_PI</span><span class=\"p\">)</span> <span class=\"o\">*</span> <span class=\"n\">up</span><span class=\"p\">;</span></code></pre></div></div><p>Now we have a seconds hand!

Note that this is a 4D vector. To make it even more clock-like, see if you can use the GLSL <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">floor()</code> function to make the seconds hand “tick” instead of rotating smoothly.</p><p>You can also make it look better by changing the lengths of the hands, so that they never overlap. Other aesthetic upgrades could be a bezel, or patterns on the clock face. Numbers are a bit more difficult, but look into textures if you have some time and wanna try it out.</p><h2 id=\"using-sin-and-cos-creatively---noise-art\">Using <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">sin()</code> and <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">cos()</code> creatively - Noise art</h2><p>The goal of this workshop was to give you enough shaders knowledge to make cool noise art, like this:</p><iframe width=\"640\" height=\"360\" frameborder=\"0\" src=\"https://www.shadertoy.com/embed/ssScDw?gui=true&amp;t=10&amp;paused=false&amp;muted=false\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe><p>How do we do this?</p><p>…</p><p>Just kinda messing around tbh.</p><p>Code:</p><ul>  <li>Starter code for example: <a href=\"https://www.shadertoy.com/view/7s2yzy\">https://www.shadertoy.com/view/7s2yzy</a></li>  <li>Example finished code: <a href=\"https://www.shadertoy.com/view/ssScDw\">https://www.shadertoy.com/view/ssScDw</a></li>  <li>Competition starter code: <a href=\"https://www.shadertoy.com/view/fsBcWd\">https://www.shadertoy.com/view/fsBcWd</a></li></ul><h3 id=\"creating-patterns-with-functions\">Creating patterns with functions</h3><p>We know we can <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">mix()</code> two colours as long as we have a value between <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">0</code> and <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">1</code>.
