You can also download the <a href="https://github.com/UTCG/workshops/releases/download/v.1.0.2/Workshop2Start.blend">Blender file</a> that we started with in the workshop!
(You also might want this <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1b/Violin_VL100.png">violin reference image</a>, put it in the same folder as the .blend file)
