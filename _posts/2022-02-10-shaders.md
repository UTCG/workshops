# UTCG Shaders Workshop

## Intro

### What is a shader?

A *pixel shader* (aka *fragment shader*) is code that runs for each pixel being rendered. There are other types of shaders (e.g. vertex shaders, geometry shaders, etc) but we won't cover them today. Generally, they're code that runs on the GPU, usually for rendering graphics. In games, they're usually used for lighting effects (they are called shaders) and other fancy effects at the end of the rendering pipeline. GPUs are great for shaders, because they're made for doing similar work for lots of different inputs - in this case, they'll run the same shader code for each pixel on the screen.

### Coding shaders

Shaders are usually written in *GLSL*, which is *OpenGL Shading Language*. It's kind of like C/C++. This is the language that Minecraft shaders use!

One important thing to note is that it does not automatically convert between integers and floats. So it will throw an error if you do something like `float x = 2;` or `float y = M_PI / 2`. To deal with this, always put a `.` after an integer, e.g. `float x = 2.` and `float y = M_PI / 2.`.

## Fragment shader basics - Mandelbrot set

To learn the basics, let's start by rendering the [Mandelbrot set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelbrot_set). Here's some [starter code](https://www.shadertoy.com/view/NdsyDX) - we won't be paying much attention to the math, so the `mandel()` function is provided (and you don't need to understand it).

### What does our shader need to do?

Our fragment shader's input is a pixel on the screen and its output is its colour, as a 4D RGBA (Red/Green/Blue/Alpha) vector.

```glsl
void mainImage( out vec4 fragColor, in vec2 fragCoord )
{
	...
}
```

We've given a variable `vec2 uv` to represent the transformed coordinates of a pixel. We'll use it and `mandel()` to calculate the colour for each pixel.

```glsl
void mainImage( out vec4 fragColor, in vec2 fragCoord )
{
	vec2 uv = fragCoord/iResolution.x;

	float value = mandel(uv.x, uv.y);  // mandel returns a value between 0 and 1

	vec3 col = vec3(value, value, value);

	fragColor = vec4(col, 1.);
}
```

Since we've put `value` into the R/G/B parts of `col`, the resulting image should be in greyscale.

### Transformation

We mentioned that `uv` are the transformed coordinates. You might recall from high school that we can transform coordinates by multiplying/dividing our vector by a number to stretch, or by adding/subtracting another vector to shift. Try doing this yourself to get the whole set in the frame!

```
void mainImage( out vec4 fragColor, in vec2 fragCoord )
{
	vec2 uv = vec2(fragCoord.x / hrztl_stretch - hrztl_shift,
		           fragCoord.y / vrtcl_stretch - vrtcl_shift);

	...
}
```

### Working with colour - `mix()`

We can make other colours by putting different values into the R/G/B parts of `col`, e.g. <span style="color:#FF8080;">`red = vec3(1., .5, .5)`</span> or <span style="color:#4080FF;">`blue = vec3(.25, .5, 1.)`</span>.

We can also interpolate between colours (or really anything) using the GLSL function `mix()`. The first two arguments are the values we want to interpolate between, and the last is the "slider value" to "slide" between the two, from `0` to `1`.

```glsl
vec3 red = vec3(1., .5, .5);
vec3 blue = vec3(.25, .5, 1.);
vec3 col = mix(red, blue, mandel);
```

### Extras

Throw `sin()`, `cos()`, and `iTime` into your colour calculation and we've got a rave going!

## Rotation, Time, and Circles - Analogue Clock

Our next example is an analogue clock. Here's some [starter code](https://www.shadertoy.com/view/fdlyz2) - we've created a `uv` variable for you, to give you the coordinates of the pixel from the centre of the screen. Here's the [finished shader](https://www.shadertoy.com/view/fslcR2) for reference.

### Creating the clock face

Clocks are circles. This is basic anthropology. But what is a circle?

A circle is all the points within some radius $r$ of the centre of the circle $\mathbf c$. So if we have a pixel whose coordinates are $\mathbf p = (x, y)$, then we can check if the pixel is within the circle by checking if $\text{length}(\mathbf p - \mathbf c) < r$. Let's do that in our code.

Let's set the centre of our clock to be the centre of the screen, and give it a radius of 0.4:

```glsl
vec2 clockCentre = vec2(0, 0);
float clockRadius = 0.4;
```

And now, let's use the GLSL `length` function to implement the circle formula and colour the clock face red:

```
if (length(uv - clockCentre) < clockRadius)
{
	col = vec3(1., 0.5, 0.5);
}
```

If you render now, you should see a big red circle in the middle of the screen!

### Initializing the seconds hand

The initial position of a clock hand, at time 0 is pointing straight up, so let's create an `up` vector to represent that:

```glsl
vec2 up = vec2(0, 0.2);
```

Now let's render it as a small white dot, the same way we rendered the clock face:

```glsl
vec2 secondsHand = up;

float handRadius = 0.02;

// put the following code AFTER the clock face colour code

if (length(uv - secondsHand) < handRadius)
{
	col = vec3(1, 1, 1);
}
```

### Making it move

Using linear algebra, we've created a `rot()` function which returns a matrix that will rotate a 2D vector clockwise by a given angle in radians ([more on rotation matrices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotation_matrix). To get a rotated vector, you multiply a rotation matrix times a vector. For example,

```glsl
vec2 northEast = vec2(1, 1);
vec2 southEast = rot(0.5 * M_PI) * northEast;
```

In our case, we want to rotate our clock hand by some angle based on time. GLSL gives us a handy variable `iTime`, which is the time in seconds since we started the shader. Let's try it out by editing our seconds hand's position:

```glsl
vec2 secondsHand = rot(iTime) * up;
```

### Getting the speed right

Great, it's rotating! But it's the wrong speed. One full rotation is $2\pi$ (aka `2. * M_PI`) radians, and it takes 60 seconds, so we'll rotate our seconds hand correspondingly:

```glsl
float seconds = iTime;

vec2 secondsHand = rot(seconds / 60. * 2. * M_PI) * up;  // 60 seconds for a rotation
```

Now we have a seconds hand! Let's try a minutes hand next, using the same strategy:

```glsl
float minutes = seconds / 60.

vec2 minutesHand = rot(minutes / 60. * 2. * M_PI) * up;  // 60 mins for a rotation

...

if (length(uv - minutesHand) < handRadius)
{
	col = vec3(1, 1, 1);
}
```

Try doing an hour hand yourself!

### Extras

To make the clock show the actual time, take a look at the GLSL `iDate` variable. Note that this is a 4D vector! To make it even more clock-like, see if you can use the GLSL `floor()` function to make the seconds hand "tick" instead of rotating smoothly.

You can also make it look better by changing the lengths of the hands, so that they never overlap. Other aesthetic upgrades could be a bezel, or patterns on the clock face. Numbers are a bit more difficult, but look into textures if you have some time and wanna try it out.
